Self reflection - Grading Spectrum Level: As of writing this I believe my program to be reaching the lower edges of the Excellent Section.
I would be hoping for a score of 70-75%.

A statement of how much of the application specification you implemented.

Any extra features you wish to bring to the assessors attention, i.e. extra functionality, Java syntax not covered in the lectures, non-standard Libraries used

Known bugs/problems : As I have not implemented Exception Handling across my menus, my menus will error and crash the program
if the correct details are not inputted. It also affects menus where information is entered e.g. Address could take in a String of just numbers instead of an actual address.
Any sources referred to during the development of the assignment (no need to reference lecture/lab materials):
